## Why Do Some People Choose to Stay in a Toxic Relationship?

With the innovation of technology in the 21st century and the creation of numerous dating apps such as Tinder, Bumble, Hinge
OkCupid and many more, there has emerged an increase in the number of people currently in a relationship and building a loving
family for themselves in their lives. Unfortunately, for many, the relationship that they’ve built with their significant other
is not filled with warmth, kindness and lovingness that one would expect from a place called home, but instead is filled with
abuse, mistreatment and disrespect towards their feelings and physical condition. Although knowing and realizing that the mishandling of their significant other towards themselves is wrong, abusive and toxic, they still choose to stay in the
relationship because of emotional manipulation, financial stability and social pressure.

<br>

Firstly, some people decide to remain in a dysfunctional relationship because they are being manipulated emotionally by their 
significant other without their knowledge. This is because master emotional manipulators tend to target and play on their
victim’s insecurities and fear, making them think that there is no other option except to stay in the relationship especially
so if the victim has confided in the manipulator about their fears and past traumas. For example, the manipulator will use the
information gained from their victim's fear and traumas to take advantage of them to reinforce their negative self-perception,
lower their self-esteem, and break their self-value to exaggerate the dangers of leaving. With that, they downplay the victim’s
ability to cope on their own and create a sense of helplessness to make the victim believe that they do not deserve a better
partner or will never find another partner. Besides that, many people who remain in a toxic relationship do so because their
significant other has isolated them from their friends, family, and other sources of support by either creating conflicts with
loved ones, discouraging outside relationships or physically limiting the victim’s social interactions to make them rely solely on 
the manipulator for emotional, physical and social support. With limited contact with the outside world, the victim will feel as 
if they have no one else to turn to and that leaving the relationship would mean losing their only source of support and they will 
be incapable of surviving without the manipulator. For example, after entering a relationship with the manipulator, they will 
start preventing the victim from going out and hanging out with their friends, forcing the victim to delete their contact 
information and telling extreme lies towards the victim’s family members so that they are considered as removed from the family 
just to guarantee that the victim does not leave the relationship. In conclusion, many people are being manipulated emotionally by 
their significant other without their knowledge to guarantee that they will never leave the toxic relationship.

<br>

Next, some people choose to continue in an abusive relationship because they are worried about their economic situation after the 
relationship. They are owning to the fact that they want to provide stability and security for the children. They fear that 
leaving might result in financial instability and inability to provide for the children, such as education, housing and 
healthcare, or losing custody due to financial weakness can compel someone to stay. They also fear the uncertainty about receiving 
adequate child support or alimony after leaving. The ex-partner might refuse to pay, or the amount will not be enough to sustain 
the household. In this case, staying seems like the safer option for them. Furthermore, some people choose to stay in codependent 
relationships because they are financially unstable or not able to support themselves without abusers. If one partner is 
economically dependent on the other, they may feel trapped in the relationship because they lack the means to support themselves 
independently. They have been out of the workforce for an extended period, due to the abuser’s control over their career choices 
or to raise children. Without savings or a steady income, they may feel they have no way to start over on their own. They might 
not have the financial means to secure housing, transportation or legal assistance, making it difficult to envision a life outside 
the relationship. Thus, numerous people are worried about their financial stability after the relationship to the extent that they 
will never leave the toxic relationship.

<br>

Lastly, some people prefer to linger in a controlling relationship because they are facing community sentiment from their close 
friends and relatives. Considering social messages that stigmatize leaving can lead to shame and guilt, causing the person to feel 
as though they are doing something wrong by wanting to leave. Cultural or religious beliefs may stigmatize divorce or separation, 
creating a fear of judgment from the community, family or religious institutions. Many societies promote the idea that 
relationships require enduring hardship and that leaving is a sign of weakness or failure, leading someone to assume they should 
tolerate the toxicity rather than leave. Women might feel pressured to be the nurturer or the caregiver who holds the family 
together, even at the cost of their well-being. At the same time, men might stay given that they feel societal pressure to tough 
it out or be the provider, even in a harmful environment. Similarly, some people prefer to stay in unhealthy relationships due to 
the fear of judgment from their immediate social circle. Leaving might mean not only ending the relationship but also losing 
friends, community support or connections that are tied to the partner. They will be rejected by their social circle, particularly 
if the toxic partner is charismatic or well-liked by others. Not to mention that family members and friends might pressure them to 
stay to preserve the family’s reputation. This pressure can make the person feel that leaving would lead to criticism or 
ostracization. Therefore, many people are facing social pressure from their close friends and relatives, such that they will never 
leave the toxic relationship.

<br>

In conclusion, emotional control, financial stability, and social standing are some of the reasons why some people prefer staying 
in a toxic relationship rather than moving away from it, despite their significant others actively harming them. To deal with 
this, the victims of unhealthy relationships should reach out to trusted individuals such as close family members for support, 
whether it be emotional or financial support. Not only that, but the victims should also connect with other people in similar 
situations through support groups for advice and guidance. Additionally, the victims should not hesitate to use a crisis hotline 
for immediate support. The people behind the hotline will help to connect you to local resources, legal help, and emergency 
shelters. In addition, the people behind the crisis hotline will also set up counselling and therapy for the victims. Through 
that, you can be helped with processing your emotions, rebuilding your self-esteem, and developing a sense of self-worth strong 
enough to sever ties with your significant other and move on without difficulties.
